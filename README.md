# CapiCount: Score Tracker for Dominoes
Steven Barrios

## Context

I love playing the Puerto Rican variation of double six dominoes. However, I noticed that the way to keep track of the score is quite antiquated paper and pen is the preferred method. There is no digital tool available that can keep track of the score while accounting for bonus points that can be earned as rounds are being played. 

Thus, this application will holistically track the score without needing pen and paper (our phones are way more accessible). I also used this as a way to learn more about React's hooks and using functional components.

## Features 

* Configure the game type of the dominoes game
  - Currently the game type available is 2 vs 2
* Declare the players in the game
* Keeps track of the points each player has accumulated 
* Keeps track of the total score of each team
